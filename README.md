Routers News
------------------

Routers is a collection of web-crawlers for various popular technology news sources.

It exposes a command-line interface to these crawlers, allowing for the distinguishing tech-news enthusiast to avoid leaving the comfort of their terminal.

It Currently Supports:

__Technology News Sources__
* Ars Technica
* Wired.com

__Major Technology Blogs__

* TechCrunch
* Mashable
* Gizmodo

__Personal Technology Blogs__

* Codes From The Underground, my blog

__Mainstream News Sources__

* USA Today
* L.A. Times

__Other Random Stuff__

* Github
* The Oatmeal
* xkcd

_(this categorization is loose, please feel free to shuffle stuff around.)_

It's Also An Experiment
------------

It is my hope that, by open-sourcing a collection of news scrapers, a community can be built around building a powerful set of real-time news aggregation tools.

The Crawlers
----------

The news crawlers used by Routers come in two varieties:

* Page scrapers which use CSS selectors to extract content from news sources.
* RSS/Atom feed parsers, which crawl articles using an RSS or Atom news feed.

Examples of both can be found in the __lib/sources__ directory.

Contributing
----------

It's easy to add a new news source:

* fork the routers news repo.
* clone it locally.
* run __npm install__ to install the libraries locally.
* create a new crawler in the __lib/sources__ directory (everything in this hierarchy is automatically loaded).
* to test your crawler run: __node ./bin/routers-news.js__.

You can also help a ton by:

* reporting when crawlers are broken.
* extending on the crawelrs, I'd love to have:
  * Dates.
  * Authors.
  * Better image extraction.
* improving on the CLI client.

Help make our dreams of a collaborative web-crawler a reality :)
